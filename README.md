Project 1 for Ivan On Tech Academy - displaying selected cryptocurrencies from Coingecko using their API and "add them" to your portfolio (Project 1 doesn't include any database, just a simple Javascript code to track

Project 1 goals:
* Display selected cryptocurrencies with their USD price on a webpage, using Coingecko API, e.g. BTC $14,000, ETH $500, etc. 
* Set the initial quantity that the user owns to 0
* Have the ability to "add" certain amount of USD value for the selected crypto and display your holdings on a page

Notes: 
* the addition to the portfolio doesn't initiate any real transaction and doesn't use any database, it just uses a variable to store and display your holdings. 
* API used: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false 
* Languages: Javascript, HTML
* Additionally I created a Proto.IO plan for a mobile application, but as agreed, my focus is the programming part.
